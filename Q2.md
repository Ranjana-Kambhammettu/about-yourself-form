# Question 2 and Answer

Question 2: Communication is one of the foundational elements of a successful website. Web developers must produce a website that effectively communicates with all sorts of visitors. Here comes web accessibility into the picture. Adding appropriate tags and attributes to a document can provide additional information about that document, which aids in better communication (with visitors and browsers).  
How can you add additional information to your HTML page for the same?
(Eg- Using proper HTML semantic tags, including lang attribute)  

Accessibilty is important in order to ensure people with disabilities can also interact and understand your website. A few things that can be done:  

1. Use of "alt" attribute for images. This helps people using screen-readers to understand the image and also helps in case the broswer is unable to display the image.
2. Not using elements like `<marquee>` as it can be difficult for people with motor disabilities to click on them.
3. Using semantic tags helps people using assisstive technology to understand what is on the page. Instead of using general `<div>` tags, using `<header>` and `<footer>` tags helps people understand the purpose of that content.
